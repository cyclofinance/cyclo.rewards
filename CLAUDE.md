# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Cyclo rewards calculator for the Flare Network. Calculates token reward
distributions for cysFLR, cyWETH, and cyFXRP holders by scraping on-chain data
from a Goldsky subgraph, computing eligible balances across 30 deterministic
snapshot blocks, and generating CSV outputs for on-chain distribution.

## Commands

All commands should be run through nix for reproducibility:

```bash
nix develop -c npm i               # Install dependencies
nix develop -c npm run start        # Full pipeline: scrape → process
nix develop -c npm run scrape       # Scrape only (fetches from subgraph into data/*.dat)
nix develop -c npm run test         # Run vitest (runs in watch mode by default)
nix develop -c npm run build        # TypeScript compilation check
```

Without nix (if nix is unavailable):

```bash
npm run test
npm run start
```

Vitest runs in watch mode. For a single run, use
`nix develop -c npx vitest run`.

## Architecture

**Pipeline:** `scraper.ts` → `index.ts` (`processor.ts` + `pipeline.ts` +
`liquidity.ts`)

- **`src/scraper.ts`** — Fetches transfer and liquidity events from Goldsky
  GraphQL subgraph up to END_SNAPSHOT block. Writes JSONL to
  `data/transfers1.dat` through `data/transfersN.dat` (split to avoid GitHub
  100MB limit) and `data/liquidity.dat`.
- **`src/index.ts`** — Main pipeline entry point. Loads env config via
  `parseEnv()`, reads scraped data files, runs the `Processor`, and writes
  balance/reward CSVs to `output/`.
- **`src/processor.ts`** — Core logic. Replays all transfers to compute
  per-account balances at each snapshot block. Handles approved source detection
  (DEX routers in config), Uniswap V2/V3 LP position tracking via factory
  contracts, penalties/bounties from `data/blocklist.txt`.
- **`src/pipeline.ts`** — Extracted helpers for data parsing and output
  formatting: `parseJsonl`, `parseBlocklist`, `formatBalancesCsv`,
  `formatRewardsCsv`, `summarizeTokenBalances`, `aggregateRewardsPerAddress`,
  `sortAddressesByReward`, `filterZeroRewards`.
- **`src/liquidity.ts`** — Queries Uniswap V3 pool tick data via multicall at
  specific blocks. Uses 3 attempts with fixed 10-second delay between retries.
- **`src/diffCalculator.ts`** — Standalone script (not part of `npm run start`).
  Compares new rewards CSV against a previous rewards CSV (e.g.,
  `output/rewards-*-old.csv`) to produce diff CSVs for underpaid, covered, and
  uncovered accounts. Currently configured for Dec 2025 epoch reconciliation.
- **`src/config.ts`** — Approved DEX routers (`REWARDS_SOURCES`), factory
  contracts (`FACTORIES`), cyToken definitions (`CYTOKENS`), RPC URL, and
  `generateSnapshotBlocks()` which uses seedrandom for deterministic block
  selection.
- **`src/constants.ts`** — Shared constants: `ONE_18` (1e18 BigInt),
  `REWARD_POOL` (current epoch pool amount), `DEC25_REWARD_POOL` (Dec 2025
  historical), CSV column headers, `VALID_ADDRESS_REGEX`, `validateAddress()`,
  `BOUNTY_PERCENT`, `RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS`, data file path constants (`DATA_DIR`,
  `OUTPUT_DIR`, etc.), and transfer file splitting constants.
- **`src/types.ts`** — TypeScript interfaces for transfers, balances, liquidity
  changes, reports.
- **`scripts/fetch-dec-2025-distributed.sh`** — Decodes on-chain distribution
  transactions to produce `output/dec-2025-distributed.csv`. Run in CI before
  the main pipeline.

## Environment Variables

Set in `.env` (loaded via dotenv at runtime):

- `RPC_URL` — Flare RPC endpoint (also set as a secret in
  `.github/workflows/git-clean.yaml`)

Epoch configuration (seed, startBlock, endBlock) is defined in the `EPOCHS`
array in `src/constants.ts`. See the epoch transition steps in `readme.md` for
how to configure a new epoch.

## Key Concepts

- **Eligible balances (2026+)**: Only LP-deposited cy* tokens earn rewards.
  Users must buy cy* from approved DEX routers/orderbook (`REWARDS_SOURCES` in
  config) and then LP them into a pool. Simply holding cy* in a wallet does not
  earn rewards.
- **Snapshots**: 30 blocks are deterministically chosen between START_SNAPSHOT
  and END_SNAPSHOT using seedrandom. Balances are sampled at each snapshot and
  averaged for reward calculation.
- **Penalties/Bounties**: Accounts in `data/blocklist.txt` are penalized:
  `penalty = average`, `bounty = penalty * BOUNTY_PERCENT / 100` (10%) goes to
  the reporter, and the cheater's `final = average - penalty + 0 = 0`. The
  remaining 90% is implicitly redistributed since it reduces total eligible
  supply. Each cheater can only appear once in the blocklist.
- **LP positions**: V2 and V3 liquidity positions are tracked. V3 positions
  query on-chain tick data to determine if they're in range. Only in-range V3
  positions count toward rewards at each snapshot.
- **Determinism**: CI (`git-clean.yaml`) runs the full pipeline and asserts no
  uncommitted changes, ensuring outputs are reproducible.
- **Epoch transitions**: See `readme.md` for the step-by-step process and the
  full rFLR emissions epochs schedule. The `diffCalculator.ts` script is only
  needed when a prior epoch had a partial distribution requiring reconciliation
  (e.g., Dec 2025).

## Data Files

- `data/transfers*.dat`, `data/liquidity.dat` — Cached JSONL from subgraph
  (large files, committed)
- `data/pools.dat` — Cached JSON array of pool addresses from subgraph
- `data/blocklist.txt` — Penalty/bounty targets
- `output/` — Generated CSVs (balances, rewards, diffs)
- `output/dispersed/` — Previously distributed reward CSVs (historical
  reference)
